This proof of concept will save an around ample amount of time spent on reports, that will lead to the better time management. The future version might even have the regression on the fog index, that will lead to the sortment of the employees according to the difficuilty of the reports."

strategies in their competition to deliver the highest quality lowest cost brand name products growing trend among retailers is to purchase on just in time basis in order to reduce inventory costs and increase returns on investment this trend has required increased working capital investments for manufacturers and requires manufacturers to more closely monitor consumer buying patterns as retailers shorten their lead times for orders currently most sunbeam products sold to u. retailers are manufactured at the company own facilities in north america however one of the company goals for is to source approximately fifty percent of parts and or products from others including suppliers in asia in order to reduce capital investment in plants while growing sales volume and to improve operating

certain federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition to laws and regulations regarding labeling and packaging of products and the sale of products containing certain environmentally sensitive materials environmental laws the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all environmental laws which are applicable to its operations compliance with environmental laws involves certain continuing costs however such costs of ongoing compliance have not resulted and are not anticipated to result in material increase in the company capital expenditures or to have material adverse effect on the company results of operations financial condition or competitive position in addition to ongoing environmental compliance at its operations the company also is actively engaged in certain environmental remediation activities relating primarily to divested operations as of december the company had been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa or state environmental agency as potentially responsible party prp in connection with seven sites subject to the federal superfund law and two sites subject to state superfund laws comparable to the federal law collectively the environmental sites exclusive of sites at which the company has been designated or expects to be designated as de minimis less than participant the superfund act and related state environmental remediation laws generally authorize governmental authorities to remediate superfund site and to assess the costs against the prps or to order the prps to remediate the site at their expense liability under the superfund law is joint and several and is imposed on strict basis without regard to degree of negligence or culpability as result the company recognizes its responsibility to determine whether other prps at superfund site are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site whenever the company has determined that particular prp is not financially responsible it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that such prp will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation to minimize the company potential liability with respect to the environmental sites the company has actively participated in steering committees and other groups of prps established with respect to such sites the company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine sites four of which are among the environmental sites referred to above and five of which have not been designated as superfund sites under federal or state law in addition the company is engaged in environmental remediation activities at site located in newburgh heights ohio where subsidiary formerly conducted operations the company has been actively cooperating with the united states nuclear regulatory commission and state regulatory authorities in developing and implementing plan for remediation of this site which remediation is anticipated to be substantially completed in the company costs for environmental remediation activities have not had material adverse effect on the company results of operations financial condition or competitive position the company has established reserves to cover the anticipated probable costs of remediation based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the company has or may have remediation responsibility as of december the amount of such reserves was approximately four percent of the company total liabilities as set forth in the consolidated financial statements such environmental reserves do not anticipate any offsets for potential insurance recoveries from certain of the company liability insurance carriers which the company continues to pursue due to uncertainty over the remedial measures to be adopted at some sites the possibility of changes in the environmental laws and the fact that joint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and state superfund sites the company ultimate future liability with respect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts reserved at fiscal year end however the company believes based on existing information that the costs of completing the environmental remediation of all sites for which the company has remediation responsibility have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have material adverse effect upon the company financial condition in december the company reached negotiated settlement with the epa with regard to notice of violation concerning the construction and operation of two paint lines at the company neosho mo facility prior to obtaining the necessary permits for construction and operation the negotiated settlement amount of recognizes the benefits of supplemental environmental project which consisted of the company installation of

looking statements as result of various factors bullet the company believes that it has sufficient management resources to complete the pending acquisitions of coleman signature brands and first alert without negatively impacting on the company ongoing operations in addition the company expects to benefit from various operating synergies arising from these acquisitions if the company fails to maintain its current operations in the manner anticipated or fails to obtain the expected operating synergies such failures could negatively effect the company financial and or operating performance which effect could be material bullet the company expects to significantly increase the amount of its outstanding indebtedness and to enter into financing arrangements which may contain various restrictive covenants in order to finance the acquisitions of coleman signature brands and first alert the continuing cost of servicing such debt could negatively effect the company future operations which effect could be material bullet the company performance should be expected to be affected by the strength of the retail economy primarily in the united states but also in canada latin america and asia weakness in consumer confidence and retail outlets including the financial weakness or bankruptcy of retail outlets especially mass merchants should be expected to adversely impact the company future financial results in addition the extended credit terms provided by the company in connection with its early buy program increase the company risk of collection of accounts receivable bullet the company operates in highly competitive environment with numerous competitors which are financially strong and capable of competing effectively with the company in the marketplace such competitors may take actions to meet the company new product introductions and other initiatives some competitors may be willing to accept lower margins and to reduce prices to compete with the company as result the company could fail to achieve anticipated sales increases to realize anticipated price increases or otherwise fail to meet its anticipated goals any of such circumstances would likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material bullet the company currently manufactures approximately of its products one of the company goals for is to source approximately of the company parts and or products from third parties the company ability to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels is dependent upon its ability to timely manufacture source and deliver products which may be sold for profit labor difficulties delays in delivery or pricing of raw materials and or sourced products scheduling and transportation difficulties management dislocations and delays in development and manufacture of new products can negatively affect operating profits although the company will use its best efforts to select suppliers for sourced product which are reliable and dependable the company planned increase in the percentage of sourced products will decrease the company immediate control of product and if such suppliers fail to deliver products as anticipated could have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material bullet as consumer goods distributor the company results of operations can be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits product recall actions and or by higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods bullet the company expects to substantially increase the amount of business conducted by it outside north america if the company fails to achieve anticipated market penetration in areas of the world into which the company currently expects to expand its sales such event is likely to have an adverse effect on the company future financial performance which effect could be material expansion of the company sales in foreign markets depends upon many factors including the states of economies in foreign countries the strength of consumer demand in those countries for products which the company sells or expects to sell in those markets the strength of competition from other global consumer products companies and other factors which may negatively affect the company anticipated performance in those markets although the recent financial instability in asia has not currently had any material impact on the company if such conditions continue and or worsen they could negatively impact the company ability to achieve anticipated sales growth in such countries the effect of which could be material to the company future financial performance bullet the company currently manufactures some products and has sales in such economies as those of mexico and venezuela both of which economies have been unstable or hyperinflationary in recent years the economies of other foreign countries important to the company expansion plans including other countries in latin america and asia could suffer similar instability in the future such factors as currency devaluations new tariffs changes in monetary policies inflation governmental instability and similar matters could negatively affect the company anticipated performance in foreign markets although the company plans to take advantage of recent economic and currency fluctuations in certain asian countries by increasing the company purchases of products from such countries at lower prices there is no guarantee that such purchasing advantage will be fulfilled or will fully overcome any lost sales opportunities in those same countries as result the economic conditions discussed above or any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material bullet significant portion of the cost of goods manufactured by the company in north america is the cost of raw materials and or components the company has implemented changes in its purchasing function which have enabled the company to purchase materials more efficiently and economically than it has in the past the future success of the company purchasing initiatives may be affected by many factors beyond the company control such as commodity pricing generally and higher prices for the specific materials required by the company although there are numerous suppliers available for the materials and components sourced by the company any unanticipated change in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the company in addition the company future initiatives to reduce the cost of materials simply may not achieve savings in amounts comparable to those previously obtained by the company significant failure by the company to maintain material costs as anticipated would likely have an adverse effect on anticipated future financial performance which effect could be material bullet the company anticipates realizing price increases from time to time for certain of its products the company operates in highly competitive industry and its ability to realize price increases may be limited due to competitive pressures if there is material failure to realize anticipated price increases margins likely will be lower than anticipated by the company and this will likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material bullet the company anticipates that it will be able to more rapidly develop and introduce substantial number of new and innovative products in the future however the company may prove unable to meet its more aggressive schedules for future product development failure to develop and manufacture new products in the amounts and with the quality anticipated or failure to reduce the cycle time for new product introductions would likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material bullet sales of certain of the company products can be negatively impacted by unseasonable weather conditions during different seasons and quarters of the year for instance the company sales of warming blankets were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of by moderate temperatures in the northern states the company has attempted to levelize production marketing and other activities related to seasonal products by implementing an early buy program such program shifts certain of the weather related risks of negative sales impact for such seasonal products to later months of the season and as result could have negative impact on future financial performance bullet the company has entered into various arrangements with third parties for the provision of back office administrative services previously provided with internal resources including provision of all necessary computer systems failure of any of these third party service providers to perform in accordance with their respective agreements with the company could result in disruptions of the company normal business operations with consequent impact on sales collections cash flow and or profitability bullet the company profitability may be negatively impacted by underabsorption of manufacturing costs resulting from underutilization of manufacturing capacity if the company sales growth is less than anticipated item properties active united states and international manufacturing warehouse and office locations are set forth below in addition to the facilities set forth below the company leases warehouse space on

time to time which the company considers to be ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business in the opinion of the company the resolution of these matters and of certain matters relating to prior operations of the predecessor individually or in the aggregate will not have material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the company the company has

sites the company continues to pursue the recovery of some environmental remediation costs from certain of its liability insurance carriers however such potential recoveries have not been offset against potential liabilities and have not been considered in determining the company environmental reserves due to uncertainty over remedial measures to be adopted at some sites the possibility of
